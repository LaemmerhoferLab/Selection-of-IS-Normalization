# Selection-of-Internal-Standard-based-Normalization-for-MS-Data
This code performs various internal standard-based normalization methods (B-MIS, CCMN, NOMIS, RUVrandom) on MS-datasets and extracts statistical parameters and metrics of intra-group variance for comparison. Ultimately, the aim is to provide a valid and simplified tool for selection of the optimum normalization strategy.
